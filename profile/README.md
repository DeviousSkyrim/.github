# Devious Skyrim

> ~ Code for NSFW Skyrim mods ~

This organization contains `code` for **NOT SAFE FOR WORK** mods for the video game Skyrim.

**No** "_Sexually Obscene Content_" is hosted in these repositories ( _per GitHub's [Acceptable Use Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-sexually-obscene-content)_ )

> If these mods require any _images / graphics_, they will be stored in _private repositories_ to be as compliant as possible with GitHub's policies.
>
> This excludes project logo images (_generally used for Skyrim SkyUI Mod Configuration Menu config UI_).
>
> These logos may contain "**_visual and/or textual depictions in artistic [contexts]_**`. They are literally art logos for video game mods.
>
> Every README hides its content inside of a collapsible markdown block with a disclaimer per the GitHub recommendation:
> - "_In some cases a disclaimer can help communicate the context of the project._"

Thanks for visiting!

> _Once finished, these mods will likely be hosted on nexusmods.com and/or loverslab.com, the popular Skyrim mod hosting sites._
